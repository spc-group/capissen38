class RegexComponent(Component[K]):

    In EPICS, it is not possible to add a field to an existing record,
    e.g. adding a ``.RnXY`` field to go alongside ``mca1.RnNM`` and
    other fields in the MCA record. A common solution is to create a
    new record with an underscore instead of the dot: ``mca1_RnBH``.

    This component include these types of field-like-records as part
    of the ROI device with a ``mca1.Rn`` prefix but performing
    subsitution on the device name using regular expressions. See the
    documentation for ``re.sub`` for full details.
