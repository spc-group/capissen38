class EnergyPositioner(Positioner):
    """The operational energy of the beamline.

    Responsible for setting both mono and ID energy with an optional
    ID offset. Setting the *energy* component will propagate to both
    real devices and so ``EnergyPositioner().energy`` is a good
    candidate for a positioner for Bluesky plans.

    Currently, the offset between the insertion device and the
    monochromator is fixed. In the future this will be replaced with a
    more sophisticated calculation.

    .. todo::

       Insert functionality to have a non-constant ID offset.

    Attributes
    ==========

    id_offset
      The offset for the insertion device relative to the mono energy.
    energy
      The pseudo positioner for the forward calculation.
    mono_energy
      The real component for the monochromator energy.
    id_energy
      The real component for the insertion device energy.

    Parameters
    ==========
    monochromator_prefix
      The CA prefix for the monochromator IOC.
    undulator_prefix
      The prefix for the insertion device energy, such that
      f"{id_prefix}:Energy.VAL" reaches the energy readback value.
