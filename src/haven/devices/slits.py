    The motor parameters listed below specify which motor records
    control which axis. The last piece of the PV prefix will be
    removed, and the motor number added on. For example, if the prefix
    is "255ida:slits:US:", and the pitch motor is "255ida:slits:m3",

    ==========
    pitch_motor
      The motor record suffix controlling the real pitch motor. Don't

    yaw_motor
      The motor record suffix controlling the real yaw motor. Don't

    horizontal_motor
      The motor record suffix controlling the real horizontal
      motor. This is different from the horizontal slits
      position. Don't include a field. E.g. "m3"
    diagonal_motor
      The motor record suffix controlling the real diagonal
      motor. Don't include a field. E.g. "m3"
