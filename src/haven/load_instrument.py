    """Load the beamline instrumentation.

    This function will reach out and query various IOCs for motor
    information based on the information in *config* (see
    ``iconfig_default.toml`` for examples). Based on the
    configuration, it will create Ophyd devices and register them with
    *registry*.

    Parameters
    ==========
    registry:
      The registry into which the ophyd devices will be placed.
    config:
      The beamline configuration read in from TOML files. Mostly
      useful for testing.
    wait_for_connection
      If true, only connected devices will be kept.
    timeout
      How long to wait for if *wait_for_connection* is true.
    return_devices
      If true, return the newly loaded devices when complete.
