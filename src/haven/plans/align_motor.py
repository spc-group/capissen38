    Find and set the position of maximum intensity in the ion chamber

    Parameters
    ==========

      A bluesky best effort callback for finding the peak position.

      Relative distance to scan in either direction.

    detector
      Which detector name to use.
    feature
      Which feature of the peak to use for alignment.

      Extra metadata to pass into the run engine.
